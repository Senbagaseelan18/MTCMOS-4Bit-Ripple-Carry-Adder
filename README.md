# MTCMOS-Based 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder

This project presents the **design and simulation** of a **4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** using **MTCMOS-based 10T Full Adders**, implemented in **Cadence Virtuoso**.

By cascading four optimized 10-transistor full adders with **MTCMOS power-gating**, we achieve:
- ✅ Lower power consumption
- ✅ Faster computation speed
- ✅ Significant transistor reduction

## 💡 MTCMOS Technique – Recap

**MTCMOS (Multi-Threshold CMOS)** uses:
- **Low-Vt transistors** in logic paths for speed
- **High-Vt sleep transistors** to cut leakage during idle time

This design leverages MTCMOS to build an energy-efficient 4-bit adder suitable for low-power VLSI systems.
